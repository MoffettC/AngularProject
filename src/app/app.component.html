		If you made it this far, Chris has managed to convince you to come to this webapp he built. 
		This is a site that has a list of 'foods' you can modify using angularJS code. 
		You can change the food's names and it will be temporarily stored on a local database. Searching, 
		deleting, and adding are also possible. <br><br>

		-Logging info is displayed bottom right <br>
		-Youll probably only appreciate this if your a software dev :)<br>
		-Mess around with the site! (theres not much anyways right now)<br>
		-Built with angularJS, nodeJS, heroku
