		If you made it this far, Chris has managed to convince you to come to this webapp he built. 
		This is a site that has a list of 'heroes' you can modify using angularJS code. 
		You can change the heroes names and it will be temporarily stored on a local database. Searching, 
		deleting, and adding are also possible. <br><br>
